Data and code for "Range of motion in the avian wing is strongly associated with 
flight behavior and body mass " by Baliga, Szabo, and Altshuler
Questions/comments -> please contact Vikram Baliga.

There are two main folders:
01_Tree-Inference: contains data and R code used to infer ML and Bayesian 
   phylogenies
02_Range-of-Motion: contains data and code used to analyze both static and 
   dynamic (ROM) morphology

Of course, the 02_Range-of-Motion folder contains the ML and Bayesian 
phylogenies, so it is not necessary to infer trees again to re-create analyses!

Wherever folders or files are numbered (e.g. "01_Lorem", "02_Ipsum"...), please
proceed in numerical order to retrace steps in our analyses.

Please see further READMEs and instructions within each main folder.
